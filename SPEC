Server
Open a listener on TCP port 9020.
Implement the server such that (all client commands case is ignored):
Client open receives a response of "Welcome to <yourname>'s Chat room<cr><lf>"
Client request "help<cr><lf>" receives a response of a list of the commands and their syntax.
Client request "test: words<cr><lf>"  receives a response of "words<cr><lf>".
Client request "name: <chatname><cr><lf>"" receives a response of "OK<cr><lf>".
Client request "get<cr><lf>" receives a response of the entire contents of the chat buffer.
Client request "push: <stuff><cr><lf>" receives a response of "OK<cr><lf>".  The result is that "<chatname>: <stuff>" is added as a new line to the chat buffer.
Client request "getrange <startline> <endline><cr><lf>" receives a response of lines <startline> through <endline> from the chat buffer.
Client request "adios<cr><lf>" will quit the current connection.
Client
Run the client by typing: <yourclientprogram> < ipaddress> <port>
Introduce yourself to the server (name: <name>)
use help
use test
use name
use get
use getrange
use adios
All the commands and responses are written out to the screen for checking later.
